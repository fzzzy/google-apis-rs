Returns the fields that are compatible to be selected in the respective sections of a report criteria, given the fields already selected in the input report and user permissions.
# Scopes

You will need authorization for the *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/dfareporting* scope to make a valid call.

If unset, the scope for this method defaults to *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/dfareporting*.
You can set the scope for this method like this: `dfareporting3 --scope <scope> reports compatible-fields-query ...`
# Required Scalar Argument
* **&lt;profile-id&gt;** *(string)*
    - The DFA user profile ID.
# Required Request Value

The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.
In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.

For example, a structure like this:

### About Cursors

The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:

* The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the `.` character. Fields can be nested such as in `-r f.s.o` .
* The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with `.`, e.g. `-r .s.s`
* You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify `-r struct.sub_struct=bar`.
* You can move the cursor one level up by using `..`. Each additional `.` moves it up one additional level. E.g. `...` would go three levels up.


# Optional Output Flags

The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.

* **-o out**
    - *out* specifies the *destination* to which to write the server's result to.
      It will be a JSON-encoded structure.
      The *destination* may be `-` to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.
      If unset, it defaults to standard output.
