Sets the store layout for the enterprise. By default, storeLayoutType is set to &#34;basic&#34; and the basic store layout is enabled. The basic layout only contains apps approved by the admin, and that have been added to the available product set for a user (using the  setAvailableProductSet call). Apps on the page are sorted in order of their product ID value. If you create a custom store layout (by setting storeLayoutType = &#34;custom&#34; and setting a homepage), the basic store layout is disabled.
# Scopes

You will need authorization for the *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/androidenterprise* scope to make a valid call.

If unset, the scope for this method defaults to *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/androidenterprise*.
You can set the scope for this method like this: `androidenterprise1 --scope <scope> enterprises set-store-layout ...`
# Required Scalar Argument
* **&lt;enterprise-id&gt;** *(string)*
    - The ID of the enterprise.
# Required Request Value

The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.
In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.

For example, a structure like this:
```
StoreLayout:
  homepage-id: string
  kind: string
  store-layout-type: string

```

can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.

* `-r .    homepage-id=lorem`
    - The ID of the store page to be used as the homepage. The homepage is the first page shown in the managed Google Play Store.
        
        Not specifying a homepage is equivalent to setting the store layout type to &#34;basic&#34;.
* `kind=eos`
    - Identifies what kind of resource this is. Value: the fixed string &#34;androidenterprise#storeLayout&#34;.
* `store-layout-type=erat`
    - The store layout type. By default, this value is set to &#34;basic&#34; if the homepageId field is not set, and to &#34;custom&#34; otherwise. If set to &#34;basic&#34;, the layout will consist of all approved apps that have been whitelisted for the user.


### About Cursors

The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:

* The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the `.` character. Fields can be nested such as in `-r f.s.o` .
* The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with `.`, e.g. `-r .s.s`
* You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify `-r struct.sub_struct=bar`.
* You can move the cursor one level up by using `..`. Each additional `.` moves it up one additional level. E.g. `...` would go three levels up.


# Optional Output Flags

The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.

* **-o out**
    - *out* specifies the *destination* to which to write the server's result to.
      It will be a JSON-encoded structure.
      The *destination* may be `-` to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.
      If unset, it defaults to standard output.
