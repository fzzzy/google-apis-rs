Creates a new alerting policy.
# Scopes

You will need authorization for at least one of the following scopes to make a valid call:

* *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform*
* *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/monitoring*

If unset, the scope for this method defaults to *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform*.
You can set the scope for this method like this: `monitoring3 --scope <scope> projects alert-policies-create ...`
# Required Scalar Argument
* **&lt;name&gt;** *(string)*
    - The project in which to create the alerting policy. The format is projects/[PROJECT_ID].Note that this field names the parent container in which the alerting policy will be written, not the name of the created policy. The alerting policy that is returned will have a name that contains a normalized representation of this name as a prefix but adds a suffix of the form /alertPolicies/[POLICY_ID], identifying the policy in the container.
# Required Request Value

The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.
In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.

For example, a structure like this:
```
AlertPolicy:
  combiner: string
  creation-record:
    mutate-time: string
    mutated-by: string
  display-name: string
  documentation:
    content: string
    mime-type: string
  enabled: boolean
  mutation-record:
    mutate-time: string
    mutated-by: string
  name: string
  notification-channels: [string]
  user-labels: { string: string }

```

can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.

* `-r .    combiner=eirmod`
    - How to combine the results of multiple conditions to determine if an incident should be opened.
* `creation-record    mutate-time=sit`
    - When the change occurred.
* `mutated-by=stet`
    - The email address of the user making the change.

* `..    display-name=sed`
    - A short name or phrase used to identify the policy in dashboards, notifications, and incidents. To avoid confusion, don&#39;t use the same display name for multiple policies in the same project. The name is limited to 512 Unicode characters.
* `documentation    content=et`
    - The text of the documentation, interpreted according to mime_type. The content may not exceed 8,192 Unicode characters and may not exceed more than 10,240 bytes when encoded in UTF-8 format, whichever is smaller.
* `mime-type=dolores`
    - The format of the content field. Presently, only the value &#34;text/markdown&#34; is supported. See Markdown (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) for more information.

* `..    enabled=false`
    - Whether or not the policy is enabled. On write, the default interpretation if unset is that the policy is enabled. On read, clients should not make any assumption about the state if it has not been populated. The field should always be populated on List and Get operations, unless a field projection has been specified that strips it out.
* `mutation-record    mutate-time=accusam`
    - When the change occurred.
* `mutated-by=takimata`
    - The email address of the user making the change.

* `..    name=justo`
    - Required if the policy exists. The resource name for this policy. The syntax is:
        projects/[PROJECT_ID]/alertPolicies/[ALERT_POLICY_ID]
        [ALERT_POLICY_ID] is assigned by Stackdriver Monitoring when the policy is created. When calling the alertPolicies.create method, do not include the name field in the alerting policy passed as part of the request.
* `notification-channels=amet.`
    - Identifies the notification channels to which notifications should be sent when incidents are opened or closed or when new violations occur on an already opened incident. Each element of this array corresponds to the name field in each of the NotificationChannel objects that are returned from the ListNotificationChannels method. The syntax of the entries in this field is:
        projects/[PROJECT_ID]/notificationChannels/[CHANNEL_ID]
        
    - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array.
* `user-labels=key=erat`
    - User-supplied key/value data to be used for organizing and identifying the AlertPolicy objects.The field can contain up to 64 entries. Each key and value is limited to 63 Unicode characters or 128 bytes, whichever is smaller. Labels and values can contain only lowercase letters, numerals, underscores, and dashes. Keys must begin with a letter.
    - the value will be associated with the given `key`


### About Cursors

The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:

* The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the `.` character. Fields can be nested such as in `-r f.s.o` .
* The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with `.`, e.g. `-r .s.s`
* You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify `-r struct.sub_struct=bar`.
* You can move the cursor one level up by using `..`. Each additional `.` moves it up one additional level. E.g. `...` would go three levels up.


# Optional Output Flags

The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.

* **-o out**
    - *out* specifies the *destination* to which to write the server's result to.
      It will be a JSON-encoded structure.
      The *destination* may be `-` to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.
      If unset, it defaults to standard output.
# Optional General Properties

The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.

* **-p $-xgafv=string**
    - V1 error format.

* **-p access-token=string**
    - OAuth access token.

* **-p alt=string**
    - Data format for response.

* **-p callback=string**
    - JSONP

* **-p fields=string**
    - Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.

* **-p key=string**
    - API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.

* **-p oauth-token=string**
    - OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.

* **-p pretty-print=boolean**
    - Returns response with indentations and line breaks.

* **-p quota-user=string**
    - Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters.
