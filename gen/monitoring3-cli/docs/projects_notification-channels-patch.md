Updates a notification channel. Fields not specified in the field mask remain unchanged.
# Scopes

You will need authorization for at least one of the following scopes to make a valid call:

* *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform*
* *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/monitoring*

If unset, the scope for this method defaults to *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform*.
You can set the scope for this method like this: `monitoring3 --scope <scope> projects notification-channels-patch ...`
# Required Scalar Argument
* **&lt;name&gt;** *(string)*
    - The full REST resource name for this channel. The syntax is:
        projects/[PROJECT_ID]/notificationChannels/[CHANNEL_ID]
        The [CHANNEL_ID] is automatically assigned by the server on creation.
# Required Request Value

The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.
In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.

For example, a structure like this:
```
NotificationChannel:
  description: string
  display-name: string
  enabled: boolean
  labels: { string: string }
  name: string
  type: string
  user-labels: { string: string }
  verification-status: string

```

can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.

* `-r .    description=et`
    - An optional human-readable description of this notification channel. This description may provide additional details, beyond the display name, for the channel. This may not exceeed 1024 Unicode characters.
* `display-name=consetetur`
    - An optional human-readable name for this notification channel. It is recommended that you specify a non-empty and unique name in order to make it easier to identify the channels in your project, though this is not enforced. The display name is limited to 512 Unicode characters.
* `enabled=true`
    - Whether notifications are forwarded to the described channel. This makes it possible to disable delivery of notifications to a particular channel without removing the channel from all alerting policies that reference the channel. This is a more convenient approach when the change is temporary and you want to receive notifications from the same set of alerting policies on the channel at some point in the future.
* `labels=key=ea`
    - Configuration fields that define the channel and its behavior. The permissible and required labels are specified in the NotificationChannelDescriptor.labels of the NotificationChannelDescriptor corresponding to the type field.
    - the value will be associated with the given `key`
* `name=sed`
    - The full REST resource name for this channel. The syntax is:
        projects/[PROJECT_ID]/notificationChannels/[CHANNEL_ID]
        The [CHANNEL_ID] is automatically assigned by the server on creation.
* `type=dolor`
    - The type of the notification channel. This field matches the value of the NotificationChannelDescriptor.type field.
* `user-labels=key=dolor`
    - User-supplied key/value data that does not need to conform to the corresponding NotificationChannelDescriptor&#39;s schema, unlike the labels field. This field is intended to be used for organizing and identifying the NotificationChannel objects.The field can contain up to 64 entries. Each key and value is limited to 63 Unicode characters or 128 bytes, whichever is smaller. Labels and values can contain only lowercase letters, numerals, underscores, and dashes. Keys must begin with a letter.
    - the value will be associated with the given `key`
* `verification-status=dolor`
    - Indicates whether this channel has been verified or not. On a ListNotificationChannels or GetNotificationChannel operation, this field is expected to be populated.If the value is UNVERIFIED, then it indicates that the channel is non-functioning (it both requires verification and lacks verification); otherwise, it is assumed that the channel works.If the channel is neither VERIFIED nor UNVERIFIED, it implies that the channel is of a type that does not require verification or that this specific channel has been exempted from verification because it was created prior to verification being required for channels of this type.This field cannot be modified using a standard UpdateNotificationChannel operation. To change the value of this field, you must call VerifyNotificationChannel.


### About Cursors

The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:

* The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the `.` character. Fields can be nested such as in `-r f.s.o` .
* The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with `.`, e.g. `-r .s.s`
* You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify `-r struct.sub_struct=bar`.
* You can move the cursor one level up by using `..`. Each additional `.` moves it up one additional level. E.g. `...` would go three levels up.


# Optional Output Flags

The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.

* **-o out**
    - *out* specifies the *destination* to which to write the server's result to.
      It will be a JSON-encoded structure.
      The *destination* may be `-` to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.
      If unset, it defaults to standard output.
# Optional Method Properties

You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that `-p` is followed by one 
or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this `-p k1=v1 k2=v2` even though the listing below repeats the
`-p` for completeness.

* **-p update-mask=string**
    - The fields to update.

# Optional General Properties

The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.

* **-p $-xgafv=string**
    - V1 error format.

* **-p access-token=string**
    - OAuth access token.

* **-p alt=string**
    - Data format for response.

* **-p callback=string**
    - JSONP

* **-p fields=string**
    - Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.

* **-p key=string**
    - API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.

* **-p oauth-token=string**
    - OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.

* **-p pretty-print=boolean**
    - Returns response with indentations and line breaks.

* **-p quota-user=string**
    - Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters.

* **-p upload-type=string**
    - Legacy upload protocol for media (e.g. &#34;media&#34;, &#34;multipart&#34;).

* **-p upload-protocol=string**
    - Upload protocol for media (e.g. &#34;raw&#34;, &#34;multipart&#34;).
