Updates or inserts a document.
# Scopes

You will need authorization for at least one of the following scopes to make a valid call:

* *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform*
* *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/datastore*

If unset, the scope for this method defaults to *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform*.
You can set the scope for this method like this: `firestore1-beta1 --scope <scope> projects databases-documents-patch ...`
# Required Scalar Argument
* **&lt;name&gt;** *(string)*
    - The resource name of the document, for example
        `projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/documents/{document_path}`.
# Required Request Value

The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.
In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.

For example, a structure like this:
```
Document:
  create-time: string
  name: string
  update-time: string

```

can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.

* `-r .    create-time=labore`
    - Output only. The time at which the document was created.
        
        This value increases monotonically when a document is deleted then
        recreated. It can also be compared to values from other documents and
        the `read_time` of a query.
* `name=eirmod`
    - The resource name of the document, for example
        `projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/documents/{document_path}`.
* `update-time=dolore`
    - Output only. The time at which the document was last changed.
        
        This value is initially set to the `create_time` then increases
        monotonically with each change to the document. It can also be
        compared to values from other documents and the `read_time` of a query.


### About Cursors

The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:

* The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the `.` character. Fields can be nested such as in `-r f.s.o` .
* The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with `.`, e.g. `-r .s.s`
* You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify `-r struct.sub_struct=bar`.
* You can move the cursor one level up by using `..`. Each additional `.` moves it up one additional level. E.g. `...` would go three levels up.


# Optional Output Flags

The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.

* **-o out**
    - *out* specifies the *destination* to which to write the server's result to.
      It will be a JSON-encoded structure.
      The *destination* may be `-` to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.
      If unset, it defaults to standard output.
# Optional Method Properties

You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that `-p` is followed by one 
or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this `-p k1=v1 k2=v2` even though the listing below repeats the
`-p` for completeness.

* **-p mask-field-paths=string**
    - The list of field paths in the mask. See Document.fields for a field
        path syntax reference.

* **-p update-mask-field-paths=string**
    - The list of field paths in the mask. See Document.fields for a field
        path syntax reference.

* **-p current-document-exists=boolean**
    - When set to `true`, the target document must exist.
        When set to `false`, the target document must not exist.

* **-p current-document-update-time=string**
    - When set, the target document must exist and have been last updated at
        that time.

# Optional General Properties

The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.

* **-p $-xgafv=string**
    - V1 error format.

* **-p access-token=string**
    - OAuth access token.

* **-p alt=string**
    - Data format for response.

* **-p callback=string**
    - JSONP

* **-p fields=string**
    - Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.

* **-p key=string**
    - API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.

* **-p oauth-token=string**
    - OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.

* **-p pretty-print=boolean**
    - Returns response with indentations and line breaks.

* **-p quota-user=string**
    - Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters.

* **-p upload-type=string**
    - Legacy upload protocol for media (e.g. &#34;media&#34;, &#34;multipart&#34;).

* **-p upload-protocol=string**
    - Upload protocol for media (e.g. &#34;raw&#34;, &#34;multipart&#34;).
