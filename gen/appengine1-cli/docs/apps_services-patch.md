Updates the configuration of the specified service.
# Scopes

You will need authorization for the *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform* scope to make a valid call.

If unset, the scope for this method defaults to *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform*.
You can set the scope for this method like this: `appengine1 --scope <scope> apps services-patch ...`
# Required Scalar Arguments
* **&lt;apps-id&gt;** *(string)*
    - Part of `name`. Name of the resource to update. Example: apps/myapp/services/default.
* **&lt;services-id&gt;** *(string)*
    - Part of `name`. See documentation of `appsId`.
# Required Request Value

The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.
In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.

For example, a structure like this:
```
Service:
  id: string
  name: string
  split:
    allocations: { string: number }
    shard-by: string

```

can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.

* `-r .    id=justo`
    - Relative name of the service within the application. Example: default.@OutputOnly
* `name=sit`
    - Full path to the Service resource in the API. Example: apps/myapp/services/default.@OutputOnly
* `split    allocations=key=0.752180990981`
    - Mapping from version IDs within the service to fractional (0.000, 1] allocations of traffic for that version. Each version can be specified only once, but some versions in the service may not have any traffic allocation. Services that have traffic allocated cannot be deleted until either the service is deleted or their traffic allocation is removed. Allocations must sum to 1. Up to two decimal place precision is supported for IP-based splits and up to three decimal places is supported for cookie-based splits.
    - the value will be associated with the given `key`
* `shard-by=diam`
    - Mechanism used to determine which version a request is sent to. The traffic selection algorithm will be stable for either type until allocations are changed.



### About Cursors

The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:

* The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the `.` character. Fields can be nested such as in `-r f.s.o` .
* The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with `.`, e.g. `-r .s.s`
* You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify `-r struct.sub_struct=bar`.
* You can move the cursor one level up by using `..`. Each additional `.` moves it up one additional level. E.g. `...` would go three levels up.


# Optional Output Flags

The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.

* **-o out**
    - *out* specifies the *destination* to which to write the server's result to.
      It will be a JSON-encoded structure.
      The *destination* may be `-` to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.
      If unset, it defaults to standard output.
# Optional Method Properties

You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that `-p` is followed by one 
or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this `-p k1=v1 k2=v2` even though the listing below repeats the
`-p` for completeness.

* **-p migrate-traffic=boolean**
    - Set to true to gradually shift traffic to one or more versions that you specify. By default, traffic is shifted immediately. For gradual traffic migration, the target versions must be located within instances that are configured for both warmup requests (https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/reference/rest/v1/apps.services.versions#InboundServiceType) and automatic scaling (https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/reference/rest/v1/apps.services.versions#AutomaticScaling). You must specify the shardBy (https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/reference/rest/v1/apps.services#ShardBy) field in the Service resource. Gradual traffic migration is not supported in the App Engine flexible environment. For examples, see Migrating and Splitting Traffic (https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/migrating-splitting-traffic).

* **-p update-mask=string**
    - Standard field mask for the set of fields to be updated.

# Optional General Properties

The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.

* **-p $-xgafv=string**
    - V1 error format.

* **-p access-token=string**
    - OAuth access token.

* **-p alt=string**
    - Data format for response.

* **-p callback=string**
    - JSONP

* **-p fields=string**
    - Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.

* **-p key=string**
    - API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.

* **-p oauth-token=string**
    - OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.

* **-p pretty-print=boolean**
    - Returns response with indentations and line breaks.

* **-p quota-user=string**
    - Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters.

* **-p upload-type=string**
    - Legacy upload protocol for media (e.g. &#34;media&#34;, &#34;multipart&#34;).

* **-p upload-protocol=string**
    - Upload protocol for media (e.g. &#34;raw&#34;, &#34;multipart&#34;).
