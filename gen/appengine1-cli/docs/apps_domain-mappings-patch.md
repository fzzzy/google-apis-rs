Updates the specified domain mapping. To map an SSL certificate to a domain mapping, update certificate_id to point to an AuthorizedCertificate resource. A user must be authorized to administer the associated domain in order to update a DomainMapping resource.
# Scopes

You will need authorization for the *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform* scope to make a valid call.

If unset, the scope for this method defaults to *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform*.
You can set the scope for this method like this: `appengine1 --scope <scope> apps domain-mappings-patch ...`
# Required Scalar Arguments
* **&lt;apps-id&gt;** *(string)*
    - Part of `name`. Name of the resource to update. Example: apps/myapp/domainMappings/example.com.
* **&lt;domain-mappings-id&gt;** *(string)*
    - Part of `name`. See documentation of `appsId`.
# Required Request Value

The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.
In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.

For example, a structure like this:
```
DomainMapping:
  id: string
  name: string
  ssl-settings:
    certificate-id: string
    pending-managed-certificate-id: string
    ssl-management-type: string

```

can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.

* `-r .    id=eirmod`
    - Relative name of the domain serving the application. Example: example.com.
* `name=dolore`
    - Full path to the DomainMapping resource in the API. Example: apps/myapp/domainMapping/example.com.@OutputOnly
* `ssl-settings    certificate-id=invidunt`
    - ID of the AuthorizedCertificate resource configuring SSL for the application. Clearing this field will remove SSL support.By default, a managed certificate is automatically created for every domain mapping. To omit SSL support or to configure SSL manually, specify SslManagementType.MANUAL on a CREATE or UPDATE request. You must be authorized to administer the AuthorizedCertificate resource to manually map it to a DomainMapping resource. Example: 12345.
* `pending-managed-certificate-id=aliquyam`
    - ID of the managed AuthorizedCertificate resource currently being provisioned, if applicable. Until the new managed certificate has been successfully provisioned, the previous SSL state will be preserved. Once the provisioning process completes, the certificate_id field will reflect the new managed certificate and this field will be left empty. To remove SSL support while there is still a pending managed certificate, clear the certificate_id field with an UpdateDomainMappingRequest.@OutputOnly
* `ssl-management-type=accusam`
    - SSL management type for this domain. If AUTOMATIC, a managed certificate is automatically provisioned. If MANUAL, certificate_id must be manually specified in order to configure SSL for this domain.



### About Cursors

The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:

* The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the `.` character. Fields can be nested such as in `-r f.s.o` .
* The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with `.`, e.g. `-r .s.s`
* You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify `-r struct.sub_struct=bar`.
* You can move the cursor one level up by using `..`. Each additional `.` moves it up one additional level. E.g. `...` would go three levels up.


# Optional Output Flags

The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.

* **-o out**
    - *out* specifies the *destination* to which to write the server's result to.
      It will be a JSON-encoded structure.
      The *destination* may be `-` to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.
      If unset, it defaults to standard output.
# Optional Method Properties

You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that `-p` is followed by one 
or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this `-p k1=v1 k2=v2` even though the listing below repeats the
`-p` for completeness.

* **-p update-mask=string**
    - Standard field mask for the set of fields to be updated.

# Optional General Properties

The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.

* **-p $-xgafv=string**
    - V1 error format.

* **-p access-token=string**
    - OAuth access token.

* **-p alt=string**
    - Data format for response.

* **-p callback=string**
    - JSONP

* **-p fields=string**
    - Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.

* **-p key=string**
    - API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.

* **-p oauth-token=string**
    - OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.

* **-p pretty-print=boolean**
    - Returns response with indentations and line breaks.

* **-p quota-user=string**
    - Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters.

* **-p upload-type=string**
    - Legacy upload protocol for media (e.g. &#34;media&#34;, &#34;multipart&#34;).

* **-p upload-protocol=string**
    - Upload protocol for media (e.g. &#34;raw&#34;, &#34;multipart&#34;).
