# Scopes

You will need authorization for at least one of the following scopes to make a valid call:

* *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube*
* *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.force-ssl*
* *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly*
* *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtubepartner*

If unset, the scope for this method defaults to *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly*.
You can set the scope for this method like this: `youtube3 --scope <scope> playlist-items list ...`
# Required Scalar Argument
* **&lt;part&gt;** *(string)*
    - The part parameter specifies a comma-separated list of one or more playlistItem resource properties that the API response will include.
        
        If the parameter identifies a property that contains child properties, the child properties will be included in the response. For example, in a playlistItem resource, the snippet property contains numerous fields, including the title, description, position, and resourceId properties. As such, if you set part=snippet, the API response will contain all of those properties.

# Optional Output Flags

The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.

* **-o out**
    - *out* specifies the *destination* to which to write the server's result to.
      It will be a JSON-encoded structure.
      The *destination* may be `-` to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.
      If unset, it defaults to standard output.
# Optional Method Properties

You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that `-p` is followed by one 
or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this `-p k1=v1 k2=v2` even though the listing below repeats the
`-p` for completeness.

* **-p page-token=string**
    - The pageToken parameter identifies a specific page in the result set that should be returned. In an API response, the nextPageToken and prevPageToken properties identify other pages that could be retrieved.

* **-p max-results=integer**
    - The maxResults parameter specifies the maximum number of items that should be returned in the result set.

* **-p id=string**
    - The id parameter specifies a comma-separated list of one or more unique playlist item IDs.

* **-p on-behalf-of-content-owner=string**
    - Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.
        
        The onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter indicates that the request&#39;s authorization credentials identify a YouTube CMS user who is acting on behalf of the content owner specified in the parameter value. This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and get access to all their video and channel data, without having to provide authentication credentials for each individual channel. The CMS account that the user authenticates with must be linked to the specified YouTube content owner.

* **-p video-id=string**
    - The videoId parameter specifies that the request should return only the playlist items that contain the specified video.

* **-p playlist-id=string**
    - The playlistId parameter specifies the unique ID of the playlist for which you want to retrieve playlist items. Note that even though this is an optional parameter, every request to retrieve playlist items must specify a value for either the id parameter or the playlistId parameter.
