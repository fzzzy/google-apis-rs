# Scopes

You will need authorization for at least one of the following scopes to make a valid call:

* *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube*
* *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.force-ssl*
* *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtubepartner*

If unset, the scope for this method defaults to *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube*.
You can set the scope for this method like this: `youtube3 --scope <scope> videos delete ...`
# Required Scalar Argument
* **&lt;id&gt;** *(string)*
    - The id parameter specifies the YouTube video ID for the resource that is being deleted. In a video resource, the id property specifies the video&#39;s ID.
# Optional Method Properties

You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that `-p` is followed by one 
or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this `-p k1=v1 k2=v2` even though the listing below repeats the
`-p` for completeness.

* **-p on-behalf-of-content-owner=string**
    - Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.
        
        The onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter indicates that the request&#39;s authorization credentials identify a YouTube CMS user who is acting on behalf of the content owner specified in the parameter value. This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and get access to all their video and channel data, without having to provide authentication credentials for each individual channel. The actual CMS account that the user authenticates with must be linked to the specified YouTube content owner.
