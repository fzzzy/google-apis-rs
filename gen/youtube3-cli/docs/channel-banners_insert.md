Uploads a channel banner image to YouTube. This method represents the first two steps in a three-step process to update the banner image for a channel:

- Call the channelBanners.insert method to upload the binary image data to YouTube. The image must have a 16:9 aspect ratio and be at least 2120x1192 pixels.
- Extract the url property&#39;s value from the response that the API returns for step 1.
- Call the channels.update method to update the channel&#39;s branding settings. Set the brandingSettings.image.bannerExternalUrl property&#39;s value to the URL obtained in step 2.
# Scopes

You will need authorization for at least one of the following scopes to make a valid call:

* *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube*
* *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.force-ssl*
* *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.upload*

If unset, the scope for this method defaults to *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube*.
You can set the scope for this method like this: `youtube3 --scope <scope> channel-banners insert ...`
# Required Request Value

The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure.
In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.

For example, a structure like this:
```
ChannelBannerResource:
  etag: string
  kind: string
  url: string

```

can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time.

* `-r .    etag=ipsum`
    - Etag of this resource.
* `kind=aliquyam`
    - Identifies what kind of resource this is. Value: the fixed string &#34;youtube#channelBannerResource&#34;.
* `url=dolores`
    - The URL of this banner image.


### About Cursors

The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply:

* The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the `.` character. Fields can be nested such as in `-r f.s.o` .
* The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with `.`, e.g. `-r .s.s`
* You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify `-r struct.sub_struct=bar`.
* You can move the cursor one level up by using `..`. Each additional `.` moves it up one additional level. E.g. `...` would go three levels up.

# Required Upload Flags

This method supports the upload of data, which *requires* all of the following flags to be set:

* **-u (simple|resumable)**
    - **simple** - Upload media all at once.
    - **resumable** - Upload media in a resumable fashion.
* **-f file**
    - Path to file to upload. It must be seekable.

The following flag *may* be set: 

* **-m mime**
    - the mime type, like 'application/octet-stream', which is the default


# Optional Output Flags

The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.

* **-o out**
    - *out* specifies the *destination* to which to write the server's result to.
      It will be a JSON-encoded structure.
      The *destination* may be `-` to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.
      If unset, it defaults to standard output.
# Optional Method Properties

You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that `-p` is followed by one 
or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this `-p k1=v1 k2=v2` even though the listing below repeats the
`-p` for completeness.

* **-p channel-id=string**
    - The channelId parameter identifies the YouTube channel to which the banner is uploaded. The channelId parameter was introduced as a required parameter in May 2017. As this was a backward-incompatible change, channelBanners.insert requests that do not specify this parameter will not return an error until six months have passed from the time that the parameter was introduced. Please see the API Terms of Service for the official policy regarding backward incompatible changes and the API revision history for the exact date that the parameter was introduced.

* **-p on-behalf-of-content-owner=string**
    - Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.
        
        The onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter indicates that the request&#39;s authorization credentials identify a YouTube CMS user who is acting on behalf of the content owner specified in the parameter value. This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and get access to all their video and channel data, without having to provide authentication credentials for each individual channel. The CMS account that the user authenticates with must be linked to the specified YouTube content owner.

# Optional General Properties

The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method.

* **-p alt=string**
    - Data format for the response.

* **-p fields=string**
    - Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.

* **-p key=string**
    - API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.

* **-p oauth-token=string**
    - OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.

* **-p pretty-print=boolean**
    - Returns response with indentations and line breaks.

* **-p quota-user=string**
    - An opaque string that represents a user for quota purposes. Must not exceed 40 characters.

* **-p user-ip=string**
    - Deprecated. Please use quotaUser instead.
