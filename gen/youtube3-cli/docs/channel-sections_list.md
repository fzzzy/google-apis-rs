# Scopes

You will need authorization for at least one of the following scopes to make a valid call:

* *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube*
* *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.force-ssl*
* *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly*
* *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtubepartner*

If unset, the scope for this method defaults to *https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly*.
You can set the scope for this method like this: `youtube3 --scope <scope> channel-sections list ...`
# Required Scalar Argument
* **&lt;part&gt;** *(string)*
    - The part parameter specifies a comma-separated list of one or more channelSection resource properties that the API response will include. The part names that you can include in the parameter value are id, snippet, and contentDetails.
        
        If the parameter identifies a property that contains child properties, the child properties will be included in the response. For example, in a channelSection resource, the snippet property contains other properties, such as a display title for the channelSection. If you set part=snippet, the API response will also contain all of those nested properties.

# Optional Output Flags

The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default.

* **-o out**
    - *out* specifies the *destination* to which to write the server's result to.
      It will be a JSON-encoded structure.
      The *destination* may be `-` to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes.
      If unset, it defaults to standard output.
# Optional Method Properties

You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that `-p` is followed by one 
or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this `-p k1=v1 k2=v2` even though the listing below repeats the
`-p` for completeness.

* **-p id=string**
    - The id parameter specifies a comma-separated list of the YouTube channelSection ID(s) for the resource(s) that are being retrieved. In a channelSection resource, the id property specifies the YouTube channelSection ID.

* **-p mine=boolean**
    - Set this parameter&#39;s value to true to retrieve a feed of the authenticated user&#39;s channelSections.

* **-p hl=string**
    - The hl parameter indicates that the snippet.localized property values in the returned channelSection resources should be in the specified language if localized values for that language are available. For example, if the API request specifies hl=de, the snippet.localized properties in the API response will contain German titles if German titles are available. Channel owners can provide localized channel section titles using either the channelSections.insert or channelSections.update method.

* **-p channel-id=string**
    - The channelId parameter specifies a YouTube channel ID. The API will only return that channel&#39;s channelSections.

* **-p on-behalf-of-content-owner=string**
    - Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.
        
        The onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter indicates that the request&#39;s authorization credentials identify a YouTube CMS user who is acting on behalf of the content owner specified in the parameter value. This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and get access to all their video and channel data, without having to provide authentication credentials for each individual channel. The CMS account that the user authenticates with must be linked to the specified YouTube content owner.

    - Data format for the response.

* **-p fields=string**
